Try
the
Pizza
Ensalata
!

the
brocollis
were
so
fresh
and
tasty
.

Told
us
to
sit
anywhere
,
and
when
we
sat
he
said
the
table
was
reserved
.

I
highly
recommend
Caviar
Russe
to
anyone
who
wants
delicious
top
grade
caviar
and
fantastic
service
.

Best
Sushi
in
town
.

(
Besides
that
there
should
be
more
restaurants
like
it
around
the
city
)
.

Sit
outside
in
the
warm
weather
;
inside
for
cozy
winter
.

The
food
and
service
were
fine
,
however
the
maitre-D
was
incredibly
unwelcoming
and
arrogant
.

The
servers
behind
the
counter
are
always
friendly
and
helpful
.

You
cannot
go
wrong
at
the
Red
Eye
Grill
.

In
fact
there
is
only
one
I've
tried
that
even
compares
(
shabu
Tatsu
)
and
even
then
I
prefer
Dokebi
.

We
had
a
good
time
.

The
pizza
’
s
are
thin
crust
and
the
menu
offers
very
creative
combinations
and
toppings
.

Just
go
to
Yamato
and
order
the
Red
Dragon
Roll
.

All
in
all
we're
already
coming
up
with
excuses
to
go
ahead
really
soon
in
the
next
few
wks
!
!
!

I
have
been
to
Roth's
twice
and
both
times
were
very
disappointing
.

We
were
offered
water
for
the
table
but
were
not
told
the
Voss
bottles
of
water
were
$
8
a
piece
.

–
Best
Mexican
place
for
lunch
in
the
financial
district
.

Not
cheap
but
very
yummy
.

It's
a
little
out
of
our
price
range
for
dining
there
except
on
special
occasions
,
but
we've
eaten
there
6
times
in
the
last
2
years
.

This
is
an
amazing
place
to
try
some
roti
rolls
.

The
cold
appetizer
dishes
taste
like
the
way
I
remember
them
to
taste
when
I
was
growing
up
in
Taiwan
.

I
loved
it
and
would
go
again
.

Food
is
excellent
.

Why
is
it
that
(
almost
)
every
good
review
is
by
"
anonymous
?
"

It
was
romantic
-
and
even
nice
even
with
my
sister
,
reminded
me
of
Italy
,
and
had
artwork
and
music
that
kept
up
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
Mediterrean
villa
.

The
place
was
quiet
and
delightful
.

Never
have
I
had
such
dramatic
delivery
guys
(
a
lot
of
huffing
and
panting
and
muttering
under
breath
b
/
c
I
live
in
a
walkup
)
who
always
seem
disappointed
with
their
tips
.

Its
a
good
thing
my
daughter
had
some
snacks
in
her
lunch
bag
.

My
girlfriend
,
being
slightly
more
aggressive
,
and
having
been
equally
disgusted
causing
her
to
throw
out
the
remainder
of
her
barely
eaten
meal
,
called
back
only
to
be
informed
that
I
was
probably
wrong
and
that
it
was
most
likely
an
oyster
,
and
that
we
were
also
blacklisted
from
their
restaurant
.

My
wife
and
I
went
to
Water's
Edge
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

When
I
got
there
I
sat
up
stairs
where
the
atmosphere
was
cozy
&
the
service
was
horrible
!

splendid

I
went
there
for
lunch
and
it
was
not
as
good
as
I
expected
from
the
reviews
I
read
.

We
did
arrive
late
for
our
reservation
so
I
can
not
complain
too
much
about
the
wait
for
a
table
.

It
melted
in
my
little
mouth
and
the
perfect
consistency-not
too
fishy
,
creamy
,
and
slightly
buttery
.

You
Can't
Go
Wrong
Here
.

The
service
was
the
only
thing
good
about
this
restaurant
.

If
you
are
going
for
the
food
,
it
will
not
be
worth
it
.

The
hostess
was
rude
and
I
got
a
distinct
feeling
that
they
did
not
want
to
serve
us
.

If
celebrities
make
you
sweat
,
then
your
in
for
a
ride
,
but
if
your
like
most
around
these
parts
then
you'll
just
yawn
and
wonder
whats
with
all
the
hype
.

Loved
it
!

Planet
Thai
is
great
!

The
entree
was
also
very
good
.

We
went
to
celebrate
two
birthdays
and
wanted
to
do
something
special
and
different
.

His
response
was
smug
,
arrogant
,
and
condescending
,
totally
consistent
with
his
deportment
on
display
all
evening
.

The
ambiance
was
a
peaceful
and
relaxing
break
amongst
all
the
kids
running
around
in
Downtown
Disney
.

I
had
the
kafta
plate
and
I
enjoyed
it
.

(
2
)
egg
custards
and
pork
buns
at
either
bakery
on
west
side
of
Mott
street
just
south
of
Canal
.

What
more
can
you
ask
for
?

This
is
by
far
my
favorite
place
in
the
neighborhood
.

Gross
food
–
Wow
-

They
were
served
warm
and
had
a
soft
fluffy
interior
.

I
think
the
pizza
is
so
overrated
and
was
under
cooked
.

WORST
PLACE
ON
SMITH
STREET
IN
BROOKLYN

Always
good
.

The
dessert
(
we
had
a
pear
torte
)
was
good
-
but
,
once
again
,
the
staff
was
unable
to
provide
appropriate
drink
suggestions
.

Get
the
pepperoni
-
YUM
-
and
a
family
style
salad
.

I
would
say
that
all
was
fine
and
tasty
but
the
heaviness
on
my
stomach
someting
that
i
can't
not
mention
or
undermine
.

I
thanked
my
friend
who
recommended
me
this
restaurant
and
will
certainly
recommend
it
to
others
.

I
was
here
a
few
weeks
back
and
we
had
the
worst
customer
service
experience
at
a
restaurant
ever
.

$
500
included
:

The
food
is
tasty
and
portion
sizes
are
appropriate
.

The
service
was
quick
and
friendly
.

i
would
recommend
reservations
on
weekends
though
.

Went
on
a
Monday
night
,
so
there
was
no
wait
for
a
table
.

Obviously
the
Chinese
translation
of
this
place
does
not
mean
Big
Wong
,
it
actually
means
Great
Prosperity
.

I
love
this
place

Highly
recommended
!

This
small
Astoria
souvlaki
spot
makes
what
many
consider
the
best
gyros
in
New
York
.

great
food

Overrated

The
restaurant
was
80
%
full
and
there
was
a
sign
posted
"
wait
to
be
seated
.
"

The
waitress
,
seems
to
be
more
concerned
of
looking
good
than
actually
waitressing
.

We
got
most
of
it
back
at
home
with
us
.

Aside
from
the
Sea
Urchin
,
the
chef
recommended
an
assortment
of
fish
including
Fatty
Yellow
Tail
,
Boton
Shrimp
,
Blue
Fin
Torro
(
Fatty
Tuna
)
,
Sea
Eel
,
etc
.

I
don't
get
it
either
.

I
will
be
going
back
and
heartily
recommend
it
!

I
will
have
to
do
more
research
before
checking
out
new
places
based
on
Diners
,
drive-ins
and
dives
reviews
.

Everyone
was
more
then
happy
with
his
choices
.

–
We
love
breakfast
food
.

Will
definitely
be
back
.

I
wasn't
here
for
the
pizza
so
I
can't
comment
on
that
yet
but
what
I
had
was
very
good
.

There
are
so
many
better
places
to
visit
!

Not
recommanded
!
!
!

We
were
less
than
impressed
.

i
would
normally
not
finish
the
brocolli
when
i
order
these
kinds
of
food
but
for
the
first
time
,
every
piece
was
as
eventful
as
the
first
one
...
the
scallops
and
prawns
was
so
fresh
and
nicely
cooked
.

This
is
the
perfect
spot
for
meeting
friends
,
having
lunch
,
dinner
,
pre-theatre
or
after-theatre
drinks
!

Great
vibe
,
lots
of
people
.

During
the
course
of
the
past
3
months
,
the
chef
and
staff
changed
and
it
was
not
for
the
better
.

This
little
place
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
and
you
sure
get
a
lot
of
food
for
your
money
.

You
can
do
it
here
.

(
The
asparagus
,
truffle
oil
,
parmesan
bruschetta
is
a
winner
!
)

They
all
know
you
.

What
really
makes
it
shine
is
the
food
,
which
is
aggressively
seasoned
with
Cyrpriot
spices
,
and
all
made
in-house
(
even
the
gyro
meat
and
sausages
)
,
and
made
of
much
higher
quality
ingredients
that
might
otherwise
be
expected
.

Great
food
,
amazing
service
,
this
place
is
a
class
act
.

Wonderful
at
holiday
time
.

This
establishment
is
the
real
deal
.

Just
ignore
the
trendy
wannabes
.

I
love
sushi
,
and
I
have
eaten
it
all
over
the
world
.

Try
their
chef's
specials
-
-
they
are
to
die
for
.

My
wife
also
ordered
a
teapot
of
hot
water
(
she
had
a
sore
throat
)
and
I
guess
that
since
it
was
only
water
,
it
wasn't
a
priority
for
them
to
actually
bring
it
.

The
decor
however
seems
to
be
the
distraction
so
you
won't
notice
that
you
just
payed
300
bucks
for
some
cold
eggplant
that
took
2
FRICKIN
HOURS
TO
COME
!
!
!

They
don't
concern
much
of
customer's
health
,
just
want
to
make
money
.

Leon
is
an
East
Village
gem
:
casual
but
hip
,
with
well
prepared
basic
French
bistro
fare
,
good
specials
,
a
warm
and
lively
atmosphere
.

We
never
had
to
wait
more
than
5
minutes
.

The
concept
of
japanese
tapas
is
newly
created
and
clearly
doesn't
work
.

We
left
,
never
to
return
.

It
was
the
first
place
we
ate
on
our
first
trip
to
New
York
,
and
it
will
be
the
last
place
we
stop
as
we
head
out
of
town
on
our
next
trip
to
New
York
.

The
owner
is
belligerent
to
guests
that
have
a
complaint
.

Insultingly
Overpriced

but
overall
i
give
it
a
10

At
$
120
for
two
people
,
however
,
this
in
no
way
represents
value
,
unless
you're
looking
to
pay
by
the
hour
for
passive-aggressive
torture
.

This
is
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
and
it
is
not
to
be
missed
.

Addicting
!

The
food
was
exceptional
.

I
tried
a
couple
other
dishes
but
wasn't
too
impressed
.

On
my
meal
I
had
to
send
back
my
eggs
for
a
simple
request
of
breaking
the
yokes
before
cooking
,
and
would
have
had
to
send
them
back
again
if
I
hadn't
rejected
the
meal
all
together
.

But
too
far
east
!

Overall
the
food
quality
was
pretty
good
,
though
I
hear
the
salmon
is
much
better
when
it
hasn't
sat
cooling
in
front
of
the
guest
.

The
fish
was
really
,
really
fresh
.

I
had
fish
and
my
husband
had
the
filet
-
both
of
which
exceeded
our
expectations
.

Wow
.

Service
,
however
,
was
excellent
...
and
I
liked
the
setting
/
atmosphere
a
lot
.

Enjoyed
the
food

There
is
something
about
their
atmosphere
that
makes
me
come
back
nearly
every
week
.

We
put
out
name
down
and
although
there
were
open
tables
we
were
told
that
it'd
be
a
30
minute
wait
.

the
spinach
is
fresh
,
definately
not
frozen
...

I
have
it
a
4
instead
of
5
because
of
the
price
(
just
chicken
tikka
masala
-
no
bread
of
rice
-
is
$
25
)
,
which
I
would
expect
at
a
upscale
Indian
restaurant
but
this
place
doesn't
have
an
upscale
feel
.

Place
is
open
till
late
,
no
dress
code
.

I
think
that
it
is
absolutely
brilliant
and
well
runned
business
operation
.

The
fish
was
adequate
,
but
inexpertly
sliced
.

I
would
recommend
Roxy's
for
that
,
but
not
for
their
food
.

Nice
value
.

i
love
their
chicken
pasta
cant
remember
the
name
but
is
sooo
good

–
We
dined
at
the
Colorado
location
today
.

The
menu
has
so
many
fish
items
and
oysters
.

HOWEVER
,
one
Sunday
afternoon
my
husband
and
I
did
go
(
although
with
my
loud
protests
)
and
were
pleasantly
surprised
.

oh
speaking
of
bathroom
,
the
mens
bathroom
was
disgusting
.

We
easily
spent
more
than
$
40
per
person
(
not
including
alcohol
)
and
were
still
hungry
.

My
GF
and
I
dine
at
Bukhara
often
as
she
lives
near
it
.

first
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
find
the
place
.

Always
a
nice
crowd
,
but
never
loud
.

The
service
varys
from
day
to
day
-
sometimes
they're
very
nice
,
and
sometimes
not
.

I
wish
I
COULD
be
refunded
!

All
their
menu
items
are
a
hit
,
and
they
serve
mimosas
.

One
of
the
best
,
if
not
THE
best
,
restaurants
in
Park
Slope
(
and
NY
in
general
)

Moderate
prices
.

I
like
Cafe
Noir
dont
get
me
wrong
,
it
is
jsut
that
the
people
who
work
there
are
evil
and
incompetent
!
!

Not
only
have
I
worked
in
restaurants
for
many
years
,
I
am
now
in
culinary
school
,
I
am
a
huge
lover
of
oysters
and
fish
,
and
my
girlfriend
is
half
Korean
!

I'm
going
back
.

I
thought
the
restaurant
was
nice
and
clean
.

Fish
was
overdone
.

The
blond
wood
decor
is
very
soothing
,
the
premium
sake
is
excellent
and
the
service
is
great
.

Once
you're
inside
,
the
real
experience
begins
.

i
have
eaten
here
a
handful
of
times
,
for
no
reason
besides
sheer
convenience
.

Arigato
Gozimas
Yuka
!

Food
was
very
good
,
but
not
what
I
would
consider
out
of
this
world
.

I
thought
going
to
Jimmys
would
give
me
a
real
Domincan
exprience
.

The
food
is
prepared
quickly
and
efficiently
.

Good
luck
getting
a
table
.

The
shrimp
scampi
was
excellent
and
the
antipasti
were
plentiful
.

One
of
us
actually
liked
the
expresso
-
that's
it
.

Poor
service
and
management

Our
experience
did
not
ever
get
any
better
.

Best
Reuben
sandwich
ever
!

It's
a
rather
cramped
and
busy
restaurant
and
it
closes
early
.

The
service
was
fast
and
friendly
and
the
food
was
very
tasty
and
they
had
the
best
hot
sauce
to
add
to
your
meals
.

Love
the
enchiladas
and
chicken
soup
-
and
be
sure
to
check
out
their
specials
.

I'd
definitely
go
back
again
.

Winnie
and
her
staff
are
the
best
crew
you
can
find
serving
you
.

But
$
500
for
a
dinner
for
two
that
didn't
include
Wine
?

The
tuna
and
wasabe
potatoes
are
excellent
.

Great
,
original
taste
.

I
never
used
to
be
a
fan
of
sakes
but
am
lately
experimenting
with
it
a
lot
more
and
am
acquiring
a
better
taste
of
it
.

I
fell
in
love
with
the
egg
noodles
in
the
beef
broth
with
shrimp
dumplings
and
slices
of
BBQ
roast
pork
.

The
worst
excuse
for
Japanese
food
I've
ever
encountered
.

I
haven't
been
to
the
other
locations
.

The
hot
dogs
are
top
notch
,
and
they're
Slamwich
is
amazing
!

The
food
can
get
pricey
but
the
prixe
fixe
tasting
menu
is
the
greatest
food
for
a
good
price
and
they
cater
the
food
to
any
food
allergies
or
food
you
don't
like
.

For
those
that
go
once
and
don't
enjoy
it
,
all
I
can
say
is
that
they
just
don't
get
it
.

Great
food
,
better
Margaritas
!

By
far
the
best
salad
I
have
had
in
a
fast
food
restaurant
.

Overall
,
I
would
go
back
and
eat
at
the
restaurant
again
.

over
.

I
have
never
left
a
restaurant
feeling
as
if
i
was
abused
,
and
wasted
my
hard
earned
money
.

Excellent
sashimi
,
and
the
millennium
roll
is
beyond
delicious
.

I
would
go
back
for
the
wine
experience
alone
.

Oh
,
and
the
cheese
fries
are
awesome
!

We
had
the
lobster
sandwich
and
it
was
FANTASTIC
.

We
paid
a
fixed
pricce
but
got
nothing
!

The
naan
was
some
of
the
best
I've
had
and
I
really
enjoyed
the
bhartha
,
not
too
tomatoey
.

Nobody
at
this
restaurant
will
give
firm
answers
about
anything
and
in
the
end
,
not
one
person
takes
responsibility
for
anything
.

–
The
food
is
here
is
incredible
,
though
the
quality
is
inconsistent
during
lunch
.

I
found
it
on
a
cold
night
,
the
perfect
spot
to
warm
up
.

The
pizza
is
yummy
and
I
like
the
atmoshpere
.

The
Yellowtail
was
particularly
good
as
well
.

Molto
bene
!

We've
tried
before
but
it
always
packed
and
doesn't
take
reservations
.

The
decor
in
this
place
is
very
diner-ish
and
the
kind
of
place
you
expect
in
the
East
Village
-
not
romantic
,
just
simple
,
small
and
sparse
.

The
pastas
are
incredible
,
the
risottos
(
particularly
the
sepia
)
are
fantastic
and
the
braised
rabbit
is
amazing
.

I
went
there
after
hearing
how
great
it
was
.

The
most
pleasant
surprise
was
the
check
that
did
not
exceed
my
expectations
as
it
always
happens
in
most
of
the
places
.

The
bread
was
stale
,
the
salad
was
overpriced
and
empty
.

The
food
they
serve
is
not
comforting
,
not
appetizing
and
uncooked
.

They
forgot
a
sandwich
,
didn't
include
plastic
forks
,
and
didn't
include
pita
with
the
hummus
platter
.

Service
ok
but
unfriendly
,
filthy
bathroom
.

The
food
is
simply
unforgettable
!

The
best
!

If
it's
nice
outside
,
request
for
a
table
in
the
balcony
.

supercilious
scorn
is
in
.

The
food
is
great
and
the
environment
is
even
better
.

Everyone
was
smiling
so
that
made
me
feel
welcome
.

–
By
far
the
best
bar
in
the
east
village
...

Not
because
you
are
"
The
Four
Seasons
"
...
–
you
are
allowed
to
charge
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
a
romatic
dinner
.

I've
enjoyed
99
%
of
the
dishes
we've
ordered
with
the
only
exceptions
being
the
occasional
too-authentic-for-me
dish
(
I'm
a
daring
eater
but
not
THAT
daring
)
.

We
all
ordered
different
entrees
so
we
could
share
.

The
rice
was
poor
quality
and
was
cooked
so
badly
it
was
hard
.

Well
,
I
guess
maybe
it
might
be
beneficial
for
the
management
to
pay
a
visit
to
Tutta
Bella
in
Columbia
City
for
some
tips
.

Dumbfoundingly
Poor

I
do
not
think
dinner
in
Manhattan
should
cost
$
400.00
where
I
am
not
swept
off
my
feet
.

Many
people
talk
about
the
great
pizza
and
poor
service
,
so
it
can't
just
be
the
rantings
of
a
few
dissatisfied
customers
.

Hurley's
is
like
Cheers
where
everyone
knows
your
name
and
they
are
ACTUALLY
glad
you
came
.

The
food
was
very
good
,
filet
mignon
was
probably
the
best
I've
ever
try
.

It
is
obvious
that
no
one
in
the
restaurant
has
any
idea
about
or
experience
with
Japanese
cuisine
.

Everything
,
and
I
mean
everything
on
the
menu
is
delectable
.

I'm
not
even
going
to
bother
to
describe
it
;
it
speaks
for
itself
.

Probably
would
not
go
back
here
.

Wretched
and
retching

I
have
been
doing
all
of
the
above
at
the
Heartland
Brewery
for
over
5
years
now
and
I
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
DISAPPOINTED
!

I
stumbled
upon
this
great
pizzeria
as
I
explored
my
new
neighborhood
.

If
you're
in
the
area
you
shouldn't
be
disappointed
.

I
love
breakfast
here
.

Chicken
teriyaki
had
tomato
or
pimentos
on
top
?
?

Kind
,
attentive
wait
staff
.

The
only
thing
that
my
friend
left
out
is
that
when
we
sat
down
at
the
bar
the
bartender
disappeared
.

Over
100
different
choices
to
create
your
own
.

The
food
was
lousy
-
too
sweet
or
too
salty
and
the
portions
tiny
.

Well
...
they
can
run
but
they
can't
hide
.

At
first
we
were
a
little
taken
aback
,
as
this
seemed
to
present
a
problem
,
although
the
restaurant
looked
fairly
empty
,
but
they
hastily
put
the
table
together
for
us
.

My
party
had
the
BBE
$
29
fixe
prix
menu
,
which
was
such
a
wonderful
deal
since
it
also
came
with
a
flight
of
sake
!

This
is
right
up
there
with
places
in
Tokyo
as
far
as
the
freshness
is
concerned
.

You
need
to
watch
your
game
,
they
will
have
it
on
for
you
.

Perhaps
now
,
Scooner
or
Later
falls
into
the
"
Dive
"
category
.

we
were
tired
and
cold
when
we
got
to
the
restaurant
,
then
we
sat
down
to
begin
ordering
appetizers
.

They
refuse
to
seat
parties
of
3
or
more
on
weekends
.

Thanks
Bloom's
for
a
lovely
trip
.

Great
neighborhood
joint
.

I'm
not
sure
where
the
other
reviewers
ate
but
it
seems
as
if
we
visited
two
different
restaurants
because
my
friends
and
I
all
enjoy
Mizu
very
much
...
and
we're
repeat
customers
.

Too
bad
the
food
wasn't
of
the
same
heritage
.

It's
a
small
cute
restaurant
.

I
loved
everythig
about
it-especially
the
shows
and
actors
.

The
wine
list
is
wonderful
and
the
food
reminds
me
of
my
recent
trip
to
Italy
.

They
have
a
huge
selection
of
different
cream
cheeses
and
all
of
their
salads
are
great
.

The
food
arrived
20
minutes
after
I
called
,
cold
and
soggy
.

To
start
off
,
approximately
8-10
oz
of
orange
juice
will
cost
you
$
3
.

Try
the
congee
and
the
donut
like
deep
fried
dough
they
call
Ow
Ley
Soh
,
a
delicious
and
sweet
tasting
bread
.

I
have
been
to
this
place
,
folks
and
it
is
BAD
.

The
place
is
beautiful
!

Bagels
are
ok
,
but
be
sure
not
to
make
any
special
requests
!

The
staff
is
very
good
.

We've
found
it
to
be
better
and
fresher
than
Kiku
which
is
comparable
in
price
.

The
pizza
’
s
are
not
huge
and
the
crust
is
thin
…
keep
that
in
mind
when
you
’
re
ordering
.

Nice
food
but
no
spice
!

–
Great
drinks
,
corn
beef
hash
,
coffee
,
B
Fast
burritos
,
Gluten
Free
menu
.

Cool
atmosphere
,
the
fire
place
in
the
back
really
ads
to
it
but
needs
a
bit
more
heat
throughout
on
a
cold
night
.
